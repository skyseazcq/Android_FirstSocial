Android_FirstSocial
================
FirstSocial is a Self-Destructing Message app that I build based on courses from teamtreehouse. It is my first social app and I learn a lot from this Android app development. 

FirstSocial allows users to send photo, video or text messages to other users that will be deleted once viewed or in 10 seconds. Facebook users can also log in with their Facebook accounts. 

Parse.com is Backend for this project. 
In order to build this project, Facebook SDK is also needed to add to build path.
The arguments in Parse.initialize() method and R.string.app_id should be replaced by your own key on Parse.com and 
app_id on facebook.
 
Have fun and keep learning!
